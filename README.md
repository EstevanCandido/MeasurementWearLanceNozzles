Registered information from a steel company that uses oxygen lance tips in steelworks
suggests that the current method for removing lance tips due to superficial wear during
operation for maintenance is subjective, heavily reliant on visual inspection. This results
in either premature or delayed removal of the tip, leading to adverse economic and
safety implications. To mitigate these impacts on maintenance activities, operator safety,
instrument lifespan, and operational costs, this study proposes a methodological basis
that includes the detection and segmentation of the wear region in oxygen lance tips
and a digital image processing method for measuring the depth of the wear region on
the surface of lance tips for future field software to use as a basis for automation to
have an indicator for timely removal of the operational equipment. For this research,
instance segmentation was employed using the Yolact model to detect and segment
the region of interest on the surface of the oxygen lance tips. Additionally, an algorithm
was developed which also serves as a methodological basis for measuring wear on
these surfaces, using the Intel RealSense software development kit for the D435
depth camera. The results indicate that the detection and segmentation of the wear
region on the surfaces of oxygen lance tips through an automated system is promising
but subject to improvements in the dataset for greater accuracy. Furthermore, they
show that depth measurement in surface wear, using the RealSense D435 software
development kit, serves as a technological basis for field algorithms to use according to
their specific needs. The combined use of these algorithms as a technological basis for
field technologies applied to the theme of oxygen lance tip maintenance can not only
minimize the impact on the maintenance plan but also extend the equipmentâ€™s lifespan,
reduce operational costs, and ensure the safety of operators.
